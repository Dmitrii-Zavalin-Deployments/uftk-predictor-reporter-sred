A prediction and reporting engine that applies rule‑based logic (with optional linear regression) and produces structured Markdown reports with plots and summaries.

This repository implements the Predictor‑Reporter described in **SnowPredictor: The Universal Field Toolkit**, which outlines the prediction framework, reporting structure, and how this module completes the SnowPredictor pipeline.
